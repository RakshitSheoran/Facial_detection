<h2>Real-Time Emotion Detection Using OpenCV and DeepFace</h2>

Overview
This project uses OpenCV for face detection and the DeepFace library for emotion recognition in real-time via webcam. Detected faces are annotated with emotion labels, providing a seamless and interactive way to analyze emotions in real time.

Features
Real-time face detection using Haar Cascade Classifier.
Emotion recognition using a pre-trained DeepFace model.
Displays live webcam feed with annotated emotions.
