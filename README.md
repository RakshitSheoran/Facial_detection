Face Detection using OpenCV
Overview
This project implements face detection using OpenCV, a popular open-source computer vision library. The program identifies and highlights faces in images or video streams using pre-trained models such as Haar Cascades or DNN-based approaches.

Features
Real-time face detection in video streams.
Detect faces in static images.
Customizable parameters for detection sensitivity.
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or later.
OpenCV library (4.x or later recommended).
Optionally, a webcam for real-time detection.# Facial_detection
